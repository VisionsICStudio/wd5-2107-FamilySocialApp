# Week One Research On CORS

This weeks research is on the topic of CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing).
Cross Origin Resource Sharing is a technology that allows data to be distributed 
accross the internet (global network). This technology is based upon request and 
response between a client endpoint call to the server hosting the data to be 
accessed and sent back to the client for comsumption in a development enviroment.

CORS is in place to govern secure requests and responses between a single cllient
requesting data from multiple origins. This means the data can be pulled from
multiple different servers across the web. Most common requests derive from a single
origin source. Modern web applications however can pul data from several different URL 
locations throughout the web.

Along as the data being requested has proper secure header references in place as 
a viable source to authenticate the data piece collected and its origin, the data 
can be requested and returned as a responce to the client for use however suits 
their development needs.
